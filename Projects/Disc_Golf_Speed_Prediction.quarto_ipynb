        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Disc golf, a sport that combines precision, strategy, and physics, has surged in popularity, captivating players with its blend of athleticism and technical finesse. Central to the game is the disc itself, where the speed rating—a measure of how fast a disc must be thrown to achieve its intended flight path—plays a critical role in performance. As a avid disc golfer I wondered if I could predicting a disc’s speed rating based on its physical characteristics to better inform myself on the relationship between disc and glide rating and help me select discs in the future. In this project, I utilize machine learning to predict disc golf speed ratings using a dataset of disc specifications, employing the XGBoost algorithm to uncover patterns in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates a disc’s speed rating based on its physical attributes, such as rim width, diameter, and bead presence. By engineering features like rim-to-diameter ratio and disc area, and using a robust XGBoost model, I aim to achieve accurate predictions and identify which features most influence a disc’s speed. This analysis not only showcases the power of machine learning in sports analytics but also offers practical applications for disc design and selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Preparation\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset, found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jakestrasler/disc-golf-disc-flight-numbers-and-dimensions), contains detailed measurements of various disc golf discs, including attributes like rim width, diameter, height, and bead presence. I used the Polars library for efficient data manipulation, dropping non-numeric flight characteristics (e.g., fade, glide, turn, stability) to focus on physical measurements and to avoid bais and lay the ground work for future models. To enrich the dataset, I engineered several features:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Rim ratio**: Rim width divided by diameter, capturing the proportional width of the rim.\n",
        "-   **Profile ratio**: Height divided by diameter, reflecting the disc’s vertical profile.\n",
        "-   **Rim area**: Product of rim width and rim depth, representing the rim’s surface area.\n",
        "-   **Disc area**: Calculated using the formula for the area of a circle, (\\pi \\times (\\text{diameter}/2)\\^2).\n",
        "-   **Flight plate ratio**: Inside rim diameter divided by total diameter, indicating the proportion of the disc’s flight plate.\n",
        "-   **Inside rim width-depth product**: Inside rim diameter multiplied by rim depth, capturing interaction effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the categorical variable “DISC TYPE” was converted to dummy variables, and the “BEAD” column was transformed into a boolean (True for “Yes,” False for “No”). These transformations ensure the dataset is suitable for machine learning."
